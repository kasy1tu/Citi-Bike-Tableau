# Citi-Bike-Tableau

In the Citi Bike Story in the Tableau file, we analyzed and compared the phenomenons between male and female bikers, the most popular start and end locations, and other demographics such as age. 

In the first slide (Male vs. Female in Distance), we observe that "Unknown" is the most indicated category with "Male" following behind it. However, females averaged a higher trip duration than males and that may be explained by the physical differences between the two sex. On the otherhand, we may also not have enough data to make a conclusion due to the large amount of "Unknown" data. 

As indicated in the Start Station vs. Age, we can see that Columbia Heights and Cranberry Street is the most popular start location amongst ages up to 50 years old. That may be because of safety or easy access reasons. 

There are many more visualizations for viewing but I thought those were the most interesting ones amonst them.
